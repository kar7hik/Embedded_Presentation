* INTRODUCTION:
*** SO WHY THERE IS SO MUCH BUZZ:
     We live in an amazingly high-tech world, surrounded by electronic gizmos and gadgets.
     Because our lives are so infused with electronics, everyone – engineers, educators, 
     entrepreneurs, students, and artists alike – can greatly benefit from learning more 
     about them. Understanding how to read schematics, solder, program, and build circuits 
     instills a unique understanding of the world we live in; not to mention, hacking and 
     making with electronics is just plain fun!
